> Thanks to [`vue-cli`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)'s [`build`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/master/docs/build.md), we could get rid of the verbose configuration of Webpack

```
>_ git clone https://github.com/OneWayTech/vue2-datatable.git
>_ cd vue2-datatable
>_ npm i
>_ npm start
```

From now on, you can customize `src/` by the live `examples/`  
If there are some features you consider necessary, your [issues](https://github.com/OneWayTech/vue2-datatable/issues/new) / PRs are always welcome!
